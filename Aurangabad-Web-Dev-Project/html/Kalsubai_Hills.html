				It gets very slippery and risky due to the slushy trail.
				It is very difficult to get clear views too so it’s best to avoid this season.

				• September and October are the flowering seasons.
				These autumn months give clear views of the surrounding peaks and forts.
				You get to experience walking on grasslands with a vast variety of flowers.

				Snake lovers get to see some rare species on the iron ladders.
