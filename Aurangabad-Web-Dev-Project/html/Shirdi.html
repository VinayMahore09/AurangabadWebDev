				<h2>history</h2>
				<p>
					Gaganbawada used to be called Bawada Mahal and comprise the current
					Gaganbawada tehsil of Kolhapur district and the current entire
					Vaibhavwadi taluka of Sindhudurg district. In 1981, Sindhudurg became
					the independent district. The entire Vaibhavwadi area which used to be
					a part of Gaganbawada Tehsil was at the foothills of Sahyadri and it
					was very tedious for people living at the foothills to come to
					Gaganbawaba for their daily needs.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					So the portion of Sahyadri foothills was separated from Gaganbawada
					tehsil of Kolhapur District and joined to the Sindhudurg District. At
					that time the villages called Vaibhavwadi, Karul, Bhuibawada, Umbarde,
					Tithavali, Achirne, etc. became a part of Sindhudurg district and
					Vaibhavwadi became the tehsil headquarters.During the rule of the
					Marathas and British raj, the Bavda estate was 243 sq.mi in extent
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					The Gagangiri Ashram and fort is only 1 km from Gaganbawada of
					Kolhapur district above Sahyadri range but geographically it is a part
					of Vaibhavwadi Tehsil of Sindhudurg district which is at the foothills
					of Sahyadri range.
