			<h2>history</h2><br>
			<p>
				The fort is quite ancient. Remnants of Microlithic man have been discovered here.
				The various Puranas (ancient scriptures) like Matsyapurana, Agnipurana and Skandapurana include many references about Harishchandragad.
				Its origin is said to have been in the 6th century, during the rule of Kalachuri dynasty.
				The citadel was built during this era. The various caves probably have been carved out in the 11th century.
				In these caves are idols of Lord Vishnu. Though the cliffs are named Taramati and Rohidas, they are not related to Ayodhya. Great sage Changdev (one who created the epic Tatvasaar), used to meditate here in the 14th century. The caves are
				from the same period

			<!-- <p>
					There are about a dozen inscriptions on the inside and outside of this
					temple, out of which only a couple of inscriptions are in good
					condition now. These inscriptions reveal the names of few kings and
					their officers. All these inscriptions except one are in Kannada
					language and script. The only Devanagari inscription in Sanskrit
					language is by Singhan-II and is located on the outer wall near South
					entrance of the temple.

			<h2>Notable Places To Visit </h2> <br>

			<h3>1.	Kedareshwar Cave: </h3> <br>
			<p>
				Towards the right of Harishchandreshwar temple, there is the huge cave of Kedareshwar , in which there is a big Shiva Linga, which is completely surrounded by water.
				Its height from the base is five feet, and the water is waist-deep. It is quite difficult to reach the Shiva Linga because the water is ice-cold.
				There are sculptures carved out in the cave. In the monsoon it is not possible to reach this cave, as a huge stream flows across the way.
				Actually this is the origin of River Mangalganga. There is a huge rock above the Shiva Linga. There were four pillars built around the Shiva Linga to support the cave.

		<h3>Konkan Kada </h3> <br>
		<p>This cliff faces west and looks down upon the Konkan. It provides views of the surrounding region. The cliff has an overhang, but has been climbed many times.
			 One phenomenon that can be observed at this place is the vertical cloud burst,
			  in which the clouds nearing the cliff get sucked into the pit fall area below and are thrown vertically into the sky reaching more than 50 feet,
				 creating the impression of a wall that is rising straight from the edge of the cliff without entering the landmass area.
				  If you happen to visit this place in April-May, then throw your panama cap from the cliff and enjoy it rising high and falling back on the plateau.</p> <br>

					<h3>Taramati Peak </h3> <br>
					<p>Also known as Taramanchi. This is the top most point on the fort (1429 meters). Leopards are seen in the forests beyond this peak.
						 From here we can have a glimpse of the whole range of Naneghat and the forts near Murbad. From this Taramati point, we can have a glimpse of forts till Siddhagad near Bhimashankar in the south and Napta twin peaks,
						  Ghodishep (865 meters), Ajoba (1375 meters), Kulang fort (1471 meters) in the north near the Kasara region.

							<br> <br>
							<h3>Important Cares </h3> <br>
							<p>In monsoon, proper care should be taken while trekking in the rockface after Tolar khind. It is advisable not to walk on the rock face in monsoon particularly during night where one can experience heavy rainfall with thunder strikes.</p>
